## Common SEO Patterns & Their Plausible Signatures

### High-Quality Traffic Source

## Investigation Playbooks

### When Bounce Rate Spikes
1. Check which pages have highest bounce
2. Compare traffic sources - did a new source bring poor traffic?
3. Check time on page - quick bounce or slow bounce?
4. Review entry pages - are landing pages optimized?

### When Traffic Drops
1. Check traffic sources - which declined?
2. Compare top pages - did a key page drop?
3. Check date range - seasonal or sustained drop?
4. Look at entry pages - SEO ranking issue?

### When Engagement Improves
1. Identify which content drove improvement
2. Check traffic sources - new quality source?
3. Compare to previous period - what changed?
4. Look for patterns to replicate

### For New Traffic Spikes
1. Identify source (referral, social, search?)
2. Check which page(s) driving spike
3. Assess quality (bounce, duration, conversion)
4. Investigate cause (viral post, backlink, ranking jump?)
